## Application functionality

The "Mbed Bomberman" game is a simplified version of the classic Bomberman game, with the following rules:

- Two players compete in the game.
- Each player can only drop one bomb at a time.
- The board is fixed and must have a minimum size of 76x72.
- Player characters are 2x2 in size.
- The bombs are the same 2x2 size.
- When a bomb explodes, it creates an explosion that also has a rowxcolumn maximum.

## Building and running

1. Connect a USB cable between the USB port on the board and the host computer.
1. Run the following command to build the Bomberman project and program the microcontroller flash memory:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/ssferraz/mbed-bomberman.git
    $ mbed deploy
    ```
    
Alternatively, you can manually copy the binary to the board, which you mount on the host computer over USB.
